## The Handshake Problem

At a meeting attended by a group of people, four people shook hands with one other person,
six people shook hands with two other people, two people shook hands with three other people,
and the rest shook hands with four other people.
No two people shook hands with each other more than once, and a total of 23 handshakes occurred.

How many people attended the meetings?
